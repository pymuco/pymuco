        execute the appropriate command for playing the audio file. The audio
        file is removed from the system after playing.

        - On Linux or macOS, this method uses `aplay` or `afplay` respectively.
        - On Windows, it uses the `powershell` command with the `Media.SoundPlayer`
          class to play the audio file.

        If the platform is unsupported, this method prints a message and returns.

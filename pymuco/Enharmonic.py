class Enharmonic:
    """
    Represents a musical note and provides functionality to determine its
    enharmonics.

    Attributes:
    -----------
        _note_name (ScientificPitchNotation): a ScientificPitchNotation object
        representing the note
        _is_enharmonic (bool): a boolean value indicating whether the note has
        an enharmonic
        _enharmonics (dict): a dictionary of notes and their enharmonics

    Methods:
    --------
        __init__(self, note):
            Initializes an Enharmonic object with a ScientificPitchNotation
            object representing a musical note. The _note_name instance
            variable is set to the input note, and the _is_enharmonic instance
            variable is set to True if the note has an enharmonic, and False
            otherwise. The _enharmonics instance variable is created by calling
            the enharmonic_mapping() method of the EnharmonicMapping class,
            which returns a dictionary of notes and their enharmonics.

        get_enharmonic(self):
            Returns a string representing the enharmonic of the note, or the
            original note name if it has no enharmonic.

        get_all_enharmonics(self):
            Returns a list of all the note names that are enharmonics of the
            original note, or a list containing only the original note name if
            it has no enharmonic.

        is_enharmonic(self):
            Returns True if the note has an enharmonic, and False otherwise.

        _calculate_enharmonic(self):
            Calculates the enharmonic of the note by looking up the _note_name
            instance variable in the _enharmonics instance variable. If the
            note is not found as a key, it looks up the value and returns the
            corresponding key.

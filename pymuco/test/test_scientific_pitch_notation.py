class TestValidPitch(unittest.TestCase):
    """
    Unit test for the is_valid_pitch and invalid_pitch methods of the
    ScientificPitchNotation class.

    The ScientificPitchNotation class is a class for representing musical
    pitches in scientific pitch notation. This test suite checks if the
    is_valid_pitch and invalid_pitch methods of the ScientificPitchNotation
    class behave as expected.

    Tested class
    ------------
    ScientificPitchNotation

    Test methods
    ------------
    1. test_valid_pitch: checks if all valid pitches are recognized as valid by
    the is_valid_pitch method.
    2. test_invalid_pitch: checks if the invalid_pitch method raises a
    ValueError when an invalid pitch is given as input.

    Test procedure
    ---------------
    1. Create an instance of ScientificPitchNotation.
    2. Call the method being tested with the input.
    3. Verify that the output is correct.

    Returns
    -------
    None
        This function does not return anything.

    See Also
    --------
    is_valid_pitch: Method of ScientificPitchNotation class that checks if a
    pitch is valid. invalid_pitch: Method of ScientificPitchNotation class that
    raises a ValueError if a pitch is invalid.

    Notes
    -----
    In scientific pitch notation, the pitch of a note is represented by a
    letter from A to G, optionally followed by a number indicating the octave
    (e.g., C4 is middle C).

    Examples
    --------
    To run the tests in this class, create an instance of TestValidPitch and
    call the `run` method.

    >>> test_valid_pitch = TestValidPitch()
    >>> test_valid_pitch.run()

    def test_valid_pitch(self):

        Test the `is_valid_pitch` method of the `ScientificPitchNotation`
        class.

        Tests if all valid pitches are recognized as valid by the
        `is_valid_pitch` method of the `ScientificPitchNotation` class. Each
        pitch is created using a combination of note name and accidental from
        the `NOTE_NAMES` and `ACCIDENTALS` constants, and the `DEFAULT_OCTAVE`.
        The `is_valid_pitch` method is called with the pitch, and the result is
        compared with the expected result (True) using the `assertEqual`
        method.

        Parameters:
        -----------
        self : object
            An instance of the `ScientificPitchNotation` test class.

        ---------------
        For each note name and accidental combination in `NOTE_NAMES` and
        `ACCIDENTALS` constants, create a pitch using
        `ScientificPitchNotation`. Call the `is_valid_pitch` method with the
        created pitch and compare the result with the expected result (True)
        using the `assertEqual` method.

        Expected behavior:
        ------------------
        The `is_valid_pitch` method of the `ScientificPitchNotation` class
        should recognize all valid pitches as valid.

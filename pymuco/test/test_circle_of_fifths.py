    """
    The TestCircleOfFifths class is a unit test that verifies the functionality
    of the CircleOfFifths class.

    The CircleOfFifths class is expected to have two methods, circle_of_fifths
    and relative_minors, which return pre-defined lists of musical keys. The
    test_circle_of_fifths method ensures that the circle_of_fifths method
    returns the expected list of keys, and the test_relative_minors method
    ensures that the relative_minors method returns the expected list of
    relative minor keys. If either method returns a list that is not equal to
    the pre-defined list, the corresponding test will fail.

        Unit test to verify the functionality of the 'circle_of_fifths' method.

    test_relative_minors(self):

    TestMIDINoteConverter is a class that contains unit tests for the
    note_name_to_midi_note method of the MIDINoteConverter class.

    Attributes
    ----------
    _NOTES : dict
        A dictionary of MIDI notes and their corresponding scientific pitch
        notation.

    Methods
    -------
    test_note_name_to_midi_note():
        Tests the note_name_to_midi_note method by looping through the _NOTES
        dictionary and asserting that the calculated MIDI value of each note is
        equal to the expected MIDI value.

    Notes
    -----
    This class is likely part of a larger test suite that tests the
    functionality of the MIDINoteConverter class.

        Test the method note_name_to_midi_note of the MIDINoteConverter class.

        This test loops through a dictionary of notes and their corresponding
        MIDI values, converts each note to its MIDI value using the
        note_name_to_midi_note method, and asserts that the calculated MIDI
        value is equal to the expected MIDI value. The test also asserts that
        the scientific pitch notation of the note is equal to the original note
        value.

        Parameters:
        -----------
        None

        Returns:
        --------
        None

        Notes:
        ------
        - This test uses regular expressions to extract the octave and pitch
        information from the note value.
        - If the pitch is two characters or fewer, the octave and pitch are
        used to create a ScientificPitchNotation object, which is then passed
        to the note_name_to_midi_note method.
        - If the pitch is longer than two characters, the note value is split
        into two parts (before and after the slash) and each part is used to
        create a separate ScientificPitchNotation object, which is then passed
        to the note_name_to_midi_note method.

        -------

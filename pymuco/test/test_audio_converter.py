class TestAudioConverter(unittest.TestCase):
    """
    Test case for the AudioConverter class.

    This test case contains four test methods that test the
    `_validate_file_path()` method of the AudioConverter class. Each test
    method simulates a different scenario in which the file path is either
    valid or invalid and asserts that the `_validate_file_path()` method
    behaves correctly in each case.

    Methods:
    ----------
    setUp(self):
        Method called to prepare the test fixture. This method creates an
        instance of the AudioConverter class.

    test_validate_file_path_with_valid_path(self):
        Test that the `validate_file_path()` method of the AudioConverter class
        correctly validates a file path that exists and has the necessary
        permissions. This test mocks the `os.path.exists()` and `os.access()`
        methods to return True, indicating that the file path is valid.

    test_validate_file_path_with_nonexistent_path(self):
        Test that the `_validate_file_path()` method returns False if the
        specified file path does not exist. The test mocks the
        `os.path.exists()` method to always return False for the duration of
        the test and calls the `_validate_file_path()` method with a mock file
        path. The test uses the `assertRaises()` method of the unittest module
        to check that a `ValueError` is raised.

    test_validate_file_path_with_unreadable_path(self):
        Test that the `_validate_file_path()` method of the AudioConverter
        class raises a `ValueError` if the file path is not readable. The test
        mocks the `os.path.exists()` and `os.access()` methods to simulate a
        readable directory with an unreadable file. It then calls the
        `_validate_file_path()` method of an instance of AudioConverter. Since
        the file is unreadable, the method should raise a `ValueError`. The
        `assertRaises()` method of the unittest module is used to check that
        the `ValueError` is raised.

    test_validate_file_path_with_unwritable_path(self):
        Test that the `_validate_file_path()` method of the AudioConverter
        class raises a `ValueError` when the specified file path is not
        writable. The method sets up a mock object for `os.path.exists()`
        which returns True and for `os.access()` which returns True and False.
        This simulates a file path that exists but is not writable. The test
        asserts that a `ValueError` is raised when the `_validate_file_path()`
        method is called in this situation.

    The test case inherits from `unittest.TestCase`.

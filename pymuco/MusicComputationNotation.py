class MusicComputationNotation:
    """A class that represents a computational music notation capable of
    storing notes in blocks.

    Each block is comprised of a pitch and its corresponding duration.

    Attributes
    ----------
    notation : List[Tuple[ScientificPitchNotation, NoteDuration]]
        The notation as a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a
        ScientificPitchNotation object and a NoteDuration object.

    Methods
    -------
    add_block(pitch: ScientificPitchNotation, duration: NoteDuration):
        Add a block to the notation.
    remove_block(index: int):
        Remove a block from the notation.
    clear_notation():
        Clear the notation.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> notation = ComputationalNotation()
    >>> pitch = ScientificPitchNotation("C4")
    >>> duration = NoteDuration(4)
    >>> notation.add_block(pitch, duration)
    >>> notation.notation
